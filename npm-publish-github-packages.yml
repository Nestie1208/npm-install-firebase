Let's check some tutorial samples out from GitHub and some tools out of npm.

Copy to Cloud Shell control -- in the snippets below, use this control to paste commands straight to the Cloud Shell prompt.

    Set up a directory structure to organize tutorial project files plus your own project(s).

    Note: As shown below, please create the following directory from the root of your Cloud Shell home directory.

cd ~; mkdir rules-tutorial

    Switch to the tutorial working directory.

cd ~/rules-tutorial

    Check out the tutorial project from Github.

git clone \
    https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-testing \
    -b release

    Change directory to the tutorial project.

cd \
    quickstart-testing/cs-walkthrough/
